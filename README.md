This demo application demonstrates enumeration of various entities, managed by Windows Terminal Services (WTS) infrastructure, in OOP style. Thereby WTS data structures and API calls used.
Having common base class encapsulating the behaviour, the series of derived classes create each enumeration.
Application is built using MS Visual Studio IDE and tested in Windows 7 x64 OS.
